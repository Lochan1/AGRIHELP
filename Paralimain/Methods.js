             <i> <u>Scientists of our Nation have developed a waste decomposer to solve the problem of the Parali.</u></i><hr/>
             After the harvesting, the farmers can purchase this decomposer at only Rs.20/bottle which is one of a 
             very cheap alternative to tackle the parali problem.
             Farmers have to spray this waste decomposer after the harvesting of their crops and then the decomposer will decompose the organic waste.
             According to the Scientists and some officials, it is said that this waste decomposer is so powerful that it can decompose around 10,000 tons of waste in just 30-40 days.

              We can also recycle stubble to make products including paper, cardboard and animal feed. In Palla village outside Delhi, an NGO named as  "the Nandi Foundation" recently shares a tweet of its initiative in which there is  800 Millions of Tonnes of paddy residue was purchased from farmers to turn it into manure.
              <hr/>
              In a recent tweet, eminent agricultural scientist MS Swaminathan said, “In South India, stubble is not burnt as there’s economic value as animal feed. For years I pointed out many commercial uses of rice straw. We should adopt a do-ecology approach with farmers to convert rice stubble into income rather than making them agents of eco-disaster.”

              Instead of burning the stubble, a tractor-mounted machine called the Happy Seeder “cuts and lifts rice straw, sows wheat into the bare soil, and deposits the straw over the sown area.
              According to a recent study published in the journal Science, Happy Seeder can “eliminate air pollution by crop burning and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from on-farm activities by more than 78% relative to all burning options.”
              Although it is a very expensive machine. The cost of a happy seeder is more than 1 lacs which makes it unaffordable for a large section of farmers.

              Kriya Labs, an IIT-Delhi startup, has developed a machine that can convert the leftover rice straw into pulp, and that is further moulded to produce biodegradable cutlery.
              “The straw is treated with a natural solvent to separate the organic polymer from cellulose leading to the formation of pulp. The semi-solid substance is then dried and moulded into biodegradable cups, plates and jars. This entire operation is eco-friendly and sustainable,”
              <u>Kriya Labs claims that in a day they can generate 4-5 tonnes of rice pulp with residue generated by 800 acres of land every harvest season.</u>

                The problem of crop burning cannot rest entirely on farmers. For example, in Punjab, this practice has a lot to do with the groundwater crisis, and this is a well-documented fact.

               Since paddy is a water-intensive crop, why not incentivise farmers to make the shift towards millets. Besides using very little water, millets are suitable for the land available in Punjab and are highly nutritious.

                IIT of Hyderabad has inaugurated India’s first bio-bricks-based building, constructed out of agro-waste. This technology was developed to counter air pollution caused by stubble burning. 
                The bio-brick was developed as an alternative and sustainable building material that replaces stubble burning. When used in roofing and wall panelling, the bio-bricks could effectively reduce heat gain by five to six degrees. Compared to burnt clay bricks, bio-bricks would cost about ₹2-₹3 when mass-produced.
